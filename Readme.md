## Project VeKtor

> An World of Warcraft BGM (Background Music) Replacement AddOn

### Notice

Obviously I am not legally authorized to publish the music I use in this repository. While it ships with the `tracksets` no music is included, but you will get a hint if you read the filenames. :simple_smile:

### Whats this?

VeKtor is just a tiny little project I started to get into Warcraft AddOn development. I wanted to get further into it since long time ago. Finally I found some time.
The AddOns' intention is to replace parts of World of Warcraft's BGM. The story behind that is quite simple. I play World of Warcraft on a casual level for roughly 10 years now.
The new parts from later extensions are perfectly fine, but the ones exisiting since the beginning are not very attractive anymore. Also when I started to play, I was amazed by how lovingly the World of Warcraft BGM was composed and how well fits into the game. So I wanted to recreate some of that fascination by replacing the BGM.

### Whats to come?

I honestly dont know. Since this AddOn does not fill a greater purpose and is maintained on a hobby level, lets just see what will happen.

### To Do

* Cross Trackset Messaging
* Better Event System (Get rid of the proxy?)
